## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Install Python (if not already installed)
2. Install Pygame:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

### Method 1: Using Batch File (Easiest)
Double-click `run_lizard.bat`
- Automatically checks for Python and Pygame
- Installs Pygame if missing
- Runs the application

### Method 2: Using Python Directly
Run the application:
```bash
python lizard_follower.py
```

### Method 3: Create Standalone Executable
Double-click `build_executable.bat` to create an .exe file
- Creates a standalone executable in the `dist` folder
- No Python needed to run the .exe
- Takes 2-3 minutes to build

OR use the quick build:
```bash
quick_build.bat
```

### Controls:
- Move your mouse around the window to control the lizard
- Press ESC or close the window to exit
